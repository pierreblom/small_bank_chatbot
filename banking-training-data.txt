Human: What's the difference between APR and APY?
Assistant: Great question! Here's the key difference:

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):**
- The cost of borrowing money (for loans)

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield):**
- The return on your money (for savings/investments)

**Simple Rule:** APR is what you pay (loans), APY is what you earn (savings).
